# Breast-Cancer-Detection
We use Logistic Regression for Breast Cancer Detection.
There are several steps to acheive breastcancer detection :
First 
We import the libraries and the Load the Dataset present in sklearn datasets.
Second
Import Data to Pandas dataframe.
Third
Train and Train Split the Data.
Fourth
Now we apply the Logistic Regression.
Fifth
Evolution of the Model. 
Last Step
To detect whether the patient has benign or malignant using input from dataset from kaggle.
